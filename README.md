#### To Dos

- Allow deck deletion
- Only combine quantities of cards if the name and set is the same. Otherwise render set specific art if Scryfall has it
- Foil indicator
- Render the art preview that matches the card (i.e. borderless card renders borderless art)
- Mana summary on deck view needs to update in real time
- On card individual hover or click in gallery view, flip animation and show value, quantity, and if its in a deck
- Do not render card at all if no art found
- Create updated at time in localstorage so the last sync time is accurate
- Animated emblem on loading and loading/error banners or states
- Render mana symbols instead of just colours

#### ‚ùîFAQ
